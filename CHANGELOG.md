### SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES
- The addon now requires `2.1.1.0` version of NTM-CE instead of `1.5.0.0`. You can take the version from CurseForge or Modrinth.
- Due to space fluids removal on `2.0.0.0` version of NTM-CE, updating the addon via CF requires mitigation of the issue. Consider moving your fluids into a Forge fluid tank (e.g. Mekanism ones) before updating!
### Breaking Changes

### Fixes
- Fixed missing translations for existing blocks
- Fixed RBMK burner being default type
- Fixed Space furnaces not working even while it has the right atmosphere
- Fixed not being able to assemble a rocket on the server
- Fixed anvil recipe desync (when server didn't have Space recipes, meaning roughly 70% of anvil recipes wouldn't work on a dedicated server)
- Fixed any_coal_coke dictgroup, which absence caused any recipes containing it to disappear (e.g. radiation absorbers)
- Fixed biomes not having their types even after auto-registration (e.g. Dres/Duna having snow)
- Fixed planets accidentally spawning mobs even though they shouldn't
- Fixed inability to process Space ores in centrifuge and ore acidizer
- Fixed Dyson Receiver not receiving anything
- Fixed PLSS occasionally not working, can be seen on dedicated servers more frequently
- Fixed camera distance, sound repetition and incorrect player rotation while travelling in space
- Fixed crash due to spinlaunch particle
- ACTUALLY fixed log spam, especially on dedicated servers, leading to constant player disconnection
